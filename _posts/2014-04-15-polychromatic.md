Xcode plugins are all the rage right now, and [Polychromatic] by [Kolin
Krewinkel][kolin] is a nifty one: it assigns unique colors to properties, ivars,
and local variables, making connections between statements more obvious.

It's a really neat concept, I'm hoping a similar plugin will soon exist for
Sublime Text.
