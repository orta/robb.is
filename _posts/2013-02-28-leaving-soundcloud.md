After three years with the SoundCloud team, today marks my last day as a
SoundClouder. I joined as an intern in the API team, worked on the Mac app and
later joined the mobile team to work on the iPad, iPhone and Android apps.

I've had a great ride but the time has come for me to find new and bigger
challenges.

I'd like to thank all the friends I found at SoundCloud for everything they've
taught me over the years. Here's a Goodbye Playlist that captures some memorable
moments from past three years at SoundCloud:
