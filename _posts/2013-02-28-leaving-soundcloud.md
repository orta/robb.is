After three years with the SoundCloud team, today marks my last day as a
SoundClouder. I joined as an intern in the API team, worked on the Mac app and
later joined the mobile team to work on the iPad, iPhone and Android apps.

I've had a great ride but the time has come for me to find new and bigger
challenges. I'd like to learn a new programming language or two, explore new
paradigms like FRP and do more writing.

I want to thank all the friends I found at SoundCloud for everything they've
taught me over the years. _You guys rock_.

Here's a Goodbye Playlist that captures some memorable moments from past three
years at SoundCloud:
