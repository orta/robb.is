> I’m thinking about syncing tags.

[Brent Simmons] is thinking aloud about how to implement syncing in Vesper.

Notably, Vesper uses SQLite rather than Core Data in its persistence layer and
[his article][article] on the topic in the latest issue of [objc.io] comes, just
as any other article on there, highly recommended.

I'm curious to see, what the back-end of his syncing solution looks like  and
how it integrates with his SQLite layer, so I'll hope he'll keep these diary
entires coming.
