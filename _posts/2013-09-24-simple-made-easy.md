I love [Rich Hickey](https://twitter.com/richhickey‎)'s inspirational talk
_Simple Made Easy_ that he gave at Strange Loop 2011.

His separation of _simplicty_ and _easiness_ is spot-on and serves as a great
reminder why going the easy way may hurt in the long run.

Embedding the slides by themselves wouldn't to it justice, [so click through and
watch on the InfoQ website][talk].
