[Florian][florian] did some interesting measurements of drawing performances
across multiple device generations.

> on the iPhone 3G, 4, 4S and 5 as well as the iPad 3, iPad mini and iPad 4.

He compared the performance of trees of UIViews and CALayers as well as flat
bitmaps drawn with CoreGraphics.

Since CoreGraphics drawing is done on the CPU, it comes to no surprise that
retina devices face bigger performance challenges.

Also:

Since the iPad 3 is likely being supplied with iOS updates for at least another
year, it's an important one to keep around has a test device since it couples
a retina screen with a comparatively underpowered CPU.
