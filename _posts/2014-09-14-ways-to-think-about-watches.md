[Benedict Evans](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/15/ways-to-think-about-watches):

> Standing in Cupertino last week, holding an Apple watch in my hand, I was
> reminded very much of the original iPad launch. Here is an idea for a new
> thing, and the idea has been implemented very well, but it’s not quite clear
> if it’s a good idea. 

> So how do we puzzle this out? There are three strands, I think - three pieces
> of string to pull at:
>
> - How does a watch complement the smartphone you already take everywhere?
> - What does a watch do of itself that’s different?
> - What is different about something that you wear on your wrist, next to your
> skin, on display, all the time - what are the self expressive and emotional
> characteristics of this?
