description: The official Artsy app for iPhone
---

A couple of weeks ago, I had the honor of working alongside the Artsy team on
the latest update to their iPhone app.



[Artsy] is a website that tries to democratize the art world by putting it online,
they currently feature over 100.000 artworks by over 18.000 artists.

For the recent [Armory Show][armory] in New York, we added a custom floor plan
to the existing app that would help visitors of the fair find their way and
steer them to booths specifically selected for them.

I really enjoyed working with the entire team and felt very welcome when working
from their office. Thanks, [Orta], [dB], [Laura] & [Katarina].

[They are hiring, too][jobs].
