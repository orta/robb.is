A couple of weeks ago, I had the honor of working alongside the Artsy team on
the latest update to their [iPhone app][app].

[Artsy] is a website that tries to democratize the art world by putting it online,
they currently feature over 100.000 artworks by over 18.000 artists.

For the recent [Armory Show][armory] in New York, we added a custom floor plan
to the existing app that would help visitors of the fair find their way and
steer them to booths specifically selected for them.

I had a great time working with them and felt very welcome during the time that
I spent at their New York office. If you happen to be looking, [they are hiring,
too][jobs]. I highly recommend them.

Thanks, [Orta], [dB], [Laura] & [Katarina].
