[I recently linked to KSImageNamed][ksimagenamed] as a solution to the issue of
auto-completion and of image resources. Today I came across Patrick Hughes'
[script to generate image aliases as part of the build process][script].

> Each time it runs it scans a folder for images. It then compares the image
> names to collect the various platform specific and scaled versions and groups
> them together. It then #defines a block for each group that loads the image
> using imageNamed:, throws an assertion if the image doesn't load and then
> returns the image.

I think I like this one even better, since it also validates the the image
resources and points out missing Retina or iPad assets where appropriate.

Cocoa is unfortunately fairly [stringly typed][stringly-typing] and the more we
enforce at compile-time, the fewer errors can happen at run-time.
