[I recreated the logo][logo] of The Laughing Man from
[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex][gits] using
only HTML and CSS.

In the show, the Laughing Man is a notorious hacker, capable
of hacking TV cameras as well as the eyes of onlookers in
real-time, hiding his face behind his infamous logo.

<div class="image">
  <img src='/img/laughing-man.png' alt='The Laughing Man' />
</div>

[The film][film] based on the same [manga by Shirow Masamune][manga]
is one of my all time favorite movies and if you haven't already,
you should really give it a try!
