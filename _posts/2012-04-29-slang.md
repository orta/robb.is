[slang][slang] is a small hack I built the other day. Inspired by
[Dan Catt][revdancat]'s [Flambient][flambient], it allows you to apply an
interesting pixelation effect to any image. I use it to generate new backgrounds
for my desktop from screenshots of the same.
You can kind of make out the iOS simulator on this one:

<div class="image">
  <img src='/img/slang.png' alt='Slang' />
</div>

It's a simple CoffeeScript implementation that you can find [on github][repo].
I would like to have the image processing running in a background web worker,
but unfortunately, canvas and web workers are mutually exclusive at this point.
