Vib Ribboff was my submission for the Music Hackday in New York in early 2011. It is a browser based clone of an old Playstation game called [Vib Ribbon][vib_ribbon].

It uses the [Echonest API][echonest_api] to resolve beat information off of [SoundCloud tracks][soundcloud_tracks]. Then it composes a level, matching obstacles to beats in the song.
