Great write-up by Dave Wiskus about the making of [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co):

> Early on with Vesper, we realized that the existing design was okay, but felt
> cheap, like it was built using the same visual tricks everyone uses to make
> something look designed.

> The only way to pull it off well […] was to strip away everything and add back
> only the pieces that we needed.

Very inspiring
