Facebook finally released a rewrite of their mobile application, eschewing
WebViews in favor of a fully native experience.

There are some interesting tidbits in there:

Not having to layout strings yourself is probably the reason why a lot of
otherwise native applications use WebViews. They use a similar approach with
table view cells, too:

If you care about performance on iOS, make sure to take a lot [at the
article][post].
