[Jumsoft], the creators of the popular expense-tracker app Money, pulled iCloud
sync in the latest versions of their app.

Apparently, Jumsoft had to make a call here: iCloud or Core Data.

Since Core Data tends to be an all-in kind of investment, it is likely that most
of their domain objects are generated from the Managed Object Model. Pulling out
Core Data would then prove prohibitively expensive.
