[Alexei Baboulevitch](https://github.com/archagon) is reimplementing the iOS keyboard:

> I'm working on a 3rd party keyboard for iOS8 and I want it to look and feel as
> close as possible to Apple's keyboard. Unfortunately, it's not possible to
> access the keyboard view through code, so this is my attempt to imitate it by
> hand. 

> The development of this keyboard is fully open-source, so the project may not
> work at all times. At the present moment, the baseline functionality is there.
> Left to implement are special characters, Shift, multitouch, and improved
> graphics (including translucenty and dark mode).
