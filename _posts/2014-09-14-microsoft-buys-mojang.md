[Microsoft is buying Mojang](https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/):

> Yes, the deal is real. Mojang is being bought by Microsoft.

> As you might already know, Notch is the creator of Minecraft and the majority
> shareholder at Mojang. He’s decided that he doesn’t want the responsibility of
> owning a company of such global significance. Over the past few years he’s
> made attempts to work on smaller projects, but the pressure of owning
> Minecraft became too much for him to handle. The only option was to sell
> Mojang.

Good for him, let's hope Microsoft doesn't mess Minecraft up.
