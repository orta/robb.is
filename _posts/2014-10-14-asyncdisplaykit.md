Facebook open-sourced their [AsyncDisplayKit](http://asyncdisplaykit.org/):

> AsyncDisplayKit is an iOS framework that keeps even the most complex user
> interfaces smooth and responsive. It was originally built to make Facebook's
> Paper possible, and goes hand-in-hand withpop's physics-based animations — but
> it's just as powerful with UIKit Dynamics and conventional app designs.

They've mentioned this multiple times before in their tech talks on Paper, I'm
glad it's finally out.
