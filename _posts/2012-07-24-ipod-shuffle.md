As a small hack over the last couple of days, I've built an [iPod Shuffle][ipod]
with CSS and HTML. I've wired up the controls to play a couple of tracks from
SoundCloud.

<div class="image">
  <a href="/hacking-on/ipod-shuffle">
    <img src="/img/ipod-shuffle.png">
  </a>
</div>

[ipod]: /hacking-on/ipod-shuffle
