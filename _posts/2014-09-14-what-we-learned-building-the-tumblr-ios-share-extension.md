Great write-up by [Bryan Irace](http://bryan.io/post/97658826431/what-we-learned-building-the-tumblr-ios-share-extension):

> The process of building the Tumblr share extension has been fun, but also
> really frustrating at times. We’ve hit quite a few problems that we ended up
> needing to work around, and in the interest of helping you do the same, would
> like to detail all of the issues that we encountered.

> Of course, your mileage may vary with some or all of these. We’ve talked to
> other developers who haven’t had the same problems, or have hit some that we
> haven’t.

I'd like to see more blog posts like this one.
