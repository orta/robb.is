I've been meaning to redesign my website for quite some time now, this weekend
I finally got around. This new design is much more colorful than the old one.

Check out the awesome [symbolset font][symbolset] I'm using for icons. It works
by applying ligatures to whole words, for example 'love' turns into
<span class="ss-icon">love</span>.

I also started to resolve embeds in the client using JavaScript, this makes it
easier for me to publish new blog posts. As a small bonus, the embeds will
usually pick up the color of the surrounding blog post.

<div class="embed" data-url="http://soundcloud.com/frittenbude/mindestens-in-1000-jahren">

</div>

I understand that there are still a couple of rough edges strewn across the
site, I plan to fix those over the coming days. If you notice anything out of
the ordinary, make sure to send me a
<a class="ss-icon" href="mailto:robb@robb.is">mail</a>.
