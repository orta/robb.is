I've read much about the Blackwell series of indie point and click adventures and
after the recent release of the latest entry in the series, [The Blackwell Deception][deception],
I finally gave them a spin.

Written by Dave Gilbert, the games follow the story of medium-against-her-will
Rosa Blackwell and her ghost parter Joey Mallone, bringing peace to the restless
souls of recently deceased New Yorkers.

While I am still waiting for the DVD package I ordered, containing all four
games of the series, I got to download the two latest ones: _The Blackwell
Convergence_ as well as aforementioned _Blackwell Deception_.

The games, running at a decidedly oldschool 640x480, also feature a great,
jazzy soundtrack. Listen for example to Rosa's Theme from the Blackwell Deception:

Unfortunately, the team at Wadjet Eye decided to use the AGS Engine, a freeware
adventure game engine that only runs on Microsoft Windows.
I managed to get them working using VMWare Fusion, but the experience is shaky
to say the least.

Still, this is a well written series of adventure games and I urge you to
check it out.
