_Notorious Siri_ is my hack for the [Music Hack Day London 2011][mhd].

<div class="image">

</div>

[SiriProxy][siriproxy] is used to intercept the communication with Apple's
servers. Based on your song request, Notorious Siri then sends your choice of
Notorious B.I.G.'s Hypnotize and an a-cappella rendition of Queen's Bohemian
Rhapsody to the device (the latter requiring 4 iPhones 4S).

Siri's speech synthesis is synced to the beat using the timestamps obtained from
the Echonest API which were then manually tweaked, to smooth out delays in the
text-to-speech engine.

Big thanks to Universal Music for awarding me a nice pair of Dr. Dre headphones
