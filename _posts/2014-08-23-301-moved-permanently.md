[Matt Greer][mattgreer] wrote a highly detailed review of my favorite 2D Mario
game, _Super Mario World_.

It also features some super slick videos of gameplay footage as well as a basic
Mario music player.

The review was written as a web app using [ClojureScript] and [Om] and its code
can be found [on GitHub][repo], together with the sources for the program he
wrote to generate the videos.
