[Josh Abernathy](https://twitter.com/joshaber) just open-sourced his take on
ReactNative, [Few.swift](https://github.com/joshaber/Few.swift):

> Few.swift lets us express UIs as stateless, composable, immutable-ish values
> of their state. When their state changes, Few.swift calls a function to render
> the UI for that state, and then intelligently applies any changes.
>
> To put it another way, the state is the necessary complexity of the app. The
> view is a mapping from state to its representation.

> This is super cool because the only thing that's mutating is the state.
> Few.swift is in charge of making an in-place changes to the UI when the state
> changes.

Exciting times.
