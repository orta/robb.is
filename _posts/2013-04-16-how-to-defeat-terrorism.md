[Parker] writes about the bombs that struck Boston yesterday:

> The cruel measure of “success” for an act of terror, then, isn’t how much harm
> is done in the explosion itself, but whether society’s reaction allows the
> terrible memories to fester and continue to disrupt our lives.

and

> [O]ne of the most pernicious effects of terrorism is to undermine the bonds of
> trust and good faith in society. So one way to fight that is to celebrate the
> first responders and other heroes to come out of today. Celebrating the
> stories of kindness from after the bombing, many of which are truly
> remarkable. […] Noting that selflessness helps avoid perpetuating a terrible and
> cynical impression of human nature.
