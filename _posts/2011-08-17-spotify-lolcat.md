Turns out, if you run

    $ open /Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Resources/lolcat.png

on your Mac, you'll get this:

<div class="img-wrapper">
  <img src='/img/spotify-lolcat-preview-background.png' alt='OMG!' />
</div>

**Update:** Apparently, the cat is [owned by Rasmus][cat], former
Spotify lead designer.
