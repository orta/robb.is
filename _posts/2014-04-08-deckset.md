Yesterday, [Florian], [Chris] and the team at [A Color Bright][acb] released
[Deckset], a phenomenal tool to create slick-looking slides from simple
Markdown.

I've been part of the Beta and while I can't quite yet leave my abusive
relationship with Keynote, I highly recommend it to everybody who gives talks
for fun or profit.

Can't wait to see what they do next.
