GitHub just open-sourced the Mac version of their updating framework [Squirrel].

Unlike the ubiquitous [Sparkle], Squirrel requires some server-side logic to determine which update should be installed. This makes clients simpler and should allow for easier roll-backs as well as staged roll-outs.

Updates are applied automatically, as soon as the app terminates. This helps making sure that clients are always up-to-date, an approach I guess we've come to love from Chrome.

Note that it also doesn't come with a UI, so you can't rely on the familiar Sparkle changelog view and would have to roll your own.
