My former boss [Caroline](https://twitter.com/bougie) gives some great advice on
how to accomodate parents as speakers:

> A tiny human shouldn’t get in the way of a great talk though. And it turns out
> that a lot of great speakers also become parents. As a conference organizer,
> what can you do to help make your event more accommodating for a speaker with
> a baby (and thus get a kick-ass presentation)?
