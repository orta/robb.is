> 1Keyboard to rule them all!

[Eyal Wiener][eyal]'s awesome [1keyboard] allows you use your Mac's keyboard and
mouse to control other devices. Since it's using Bluetooth, you're not limited
to computers, any HID-compatible device will work. I'm using the app to quickly
enter text on my development Nexus 4.

1Keyboard is in beta right now, and while the responsivenes of the mouse can
surely be improved, it's already a welcome addition to my Android development
flow.
